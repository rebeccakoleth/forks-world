        <p class="text-xl mt-4">Fork was born on the 15th of April in 2022, in Medford, Massachusetts. She lives with her owner, Becky, and her less graceful cousin, Dexter. Dexter is a Doberman pinscher from the rural lands of Pennsylvania, and despite his size, Fork rules over him. They are the perfect example of brains over brawn.</p>
