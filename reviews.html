                    Fork is a queen. She carries herself with the utmost grace and regality. There’s not much else that needs to be said about Queen Fork. 🐈‍⬛ 👑

                    Fork exudes regality. At first, it might make you think that she is apathetic or too nonchalant, but really she just knows she’s much better than you. She’s soooo soft and beautiful. She knows her worth. If I had to rate my experience with fork I would say 5 stars!!

                    Now I’d like to preface this review by saying I’ve never met Fork. It’s pretty tragic. From what I’ve heard, she’s positively fantastic. I’ve never seen a cat yawn bigger, be more loving, enjoy butt pats more. I have all the Fork memorabilia out there — Fork shirts, Fork hats, Fork forks, the whole wazoo. One day I’d like to meet Fork. I’d like to think that I’d be asked to give butt pats. I’d happily oblige. 5 stars.

                    Fork is majestic and beautiful, and her confidence should be an inspiration for us all. To earn her respect is the highest compliment. She’s also SO CUTE. 5 stars.

                    Fork is a super silly girl. Although she may look small, she is mighty. 5 stars. 5 gazillion majillion stars.

                    Fork is a sovereign of sunrise, a monarch who believes alarms are beneath her station. Each morning, she wakes me with the most royal of summons — by sitting squarely on my head or kneading it like she’s preparing bread for the kingdom. This ceremony continues until I rise and present her rightful tribute: breakfast. It is an honor, I suppose, to serve as both her throne and her bakery. Truly, a queen with an impeccable sense of timing.

                    Never before have I attended a cat's birthday party, but now all other parties pale in comparison. Fork is such a silly gal and I love her so. Such distinctive expressions all the time--very sassy but so loving. She's the Best !!

                    I’ve never met Fork but she made Becky really happy when she was adopted and she’s really cute so I love her.
