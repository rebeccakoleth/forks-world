            <hr class="border-t-4 border-pink-500 border-solid my-6">
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 mt-4 max-w-5xl">Fork was born on the 15th of April in 2022, in Medford, Massachusetts. She lives with her owner, Becky, and her less graceful cousin, Dexter. Dexter is a Doberman pinscher from the rural lands of Pennsylvania, and despite his size, Fork rules over him. They are the perfect example of brains over brawn.
            Fork's favourite snacks are Temptations lobster-flavoured treats and catnip. Dexter occasionally samples a few of her snacks without permission.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink-600 mt-6 mb-3">Personality</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 max-w-5xl">
            Unlike many cats, Fork is remarkably brave. She's not fazed by loud noises or cleaning tools—in fact, she'll often investigate the vacuum cleaner rather than flee from it. Her boldness is matched only by her playfulness and her love of being involved in whatever her humans are doing.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink-600 mt-6 mb-3">Favorite Activities</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 max-w-5xl">
            Fork is an expert lap-sitter and has perfected the art of timing. The moment you sit down, she appears, ready to claim her throne. She's also mastered a particularly adorable trick: jumping onto my torso like a sugar glider when called. It's as cute as it sounds.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 max-w-5xl">
            Her favorite hobby, however, is opportunistic back-sitting. Bend down to tie your shoes? Fork will be there, perched on your back like you're her personal climbing structure. Pick something up off the ground? Congratulations, you're now Fork furniture.
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink-600 mt-6 mb-3">Favorite Spots</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 max-w-5xl">
            Fork is a connoisseur of sunlight. The sunroom is her domain, where she spends hours basking in the warmth like the little tiger she resembles. When she's not there, you'll find her lounging in the bay window, surveying her territory with the dignity of a queen (or judging the neighbors—it's hard to tell).
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink-600 mt-6 mb-3">Appearance</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 max-w-5xl">
            Fork looks like a miniature tiger with striking black and white stripes. Her coat is soft and beautiful, and she carries herself with the regal bearing of a much larger feline. She knows she's gorgeous, and she's not afraid to show it.
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl text-pink-600 mt-6 mb-3">Rivalries</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-green-800 max-w-5xl">
            Fork has exactly one sworn enemy: my sister. Their relationship is best described as an ongoing play-fight rivalry, with Fork holding her own despite being significantly smaller. She approaches these battles with the same fearlessness she brings to everything else in life. Some say she actually enjoys the conflict. She does.
